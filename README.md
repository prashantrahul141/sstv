# Slow Scan Television (SSTV)

Slow-scan television (SSTV) is a picture transmission method, used
mainly by amateur radio operators, to transmit and receive static
pictures via radio in monochrome or color. [Read more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television)

This uses the WRASSE SC2-180 mode because it is probably the simplest
RGB SSTV mode.
